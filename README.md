# notepad_nodejs
After I committed repositories(https://github.com/liuwangdao/notepad) in this morning,
I wonder if it is possible to write a nodejs version.
Through I haven't learned it before, it is like a hello world program and easy to accomplish.
# how it works
npm start 
visit /home/index.html
write down anything and it will be appended to msg.txt
